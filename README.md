# Semantic Segmentation


Semantic segmentation algorithm attempts to:

1. Partition the image into meaningful parts
2. While at the same time, associate every pixel in an input image with a class label (i.e., person, road, car, bus, etc.)


### Aim

To implement Semantic segmentation on images and videos using OpenCV and deep learning.
